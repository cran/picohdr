Description: High Dynamic Range (HDR) images support a large range in luminosity
    between the lightest and darkest regions of an image.  To capture this range,
    data in HDR images is often stored as floating point numbers and in formats
    that capture more data and channels than standard image types.  This package supports
    reading and writing two types of HDR images; PFM (Portable Float Map) 
    and OpenEXR images. HDR images can be converted to lower
    dynamic ranges (for viewing) using tone-mapping.  A number of
    tone-mapping algorithms are included which are based on 
    Reinhard (2002) "Photographic tone reproduction for digital images" 
    <doi:10.1145/566654.566575>.
